# Overview 

This backend service is part of the ScriptaAI project. It provides automatic code complexity evaluation using a custom-trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
The ANN analyzes submitted code and classifies it into three levels: Easy, Medium, Hard. This feature gives users instant feedback on their code, helping them track progress and identify areas for improvement.

The service is deployed with Render and is available for public use at https://scriptaai.web.app.
